# Minesweeper Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python and Pygame. It includes an AI solver that can automatically play the game.

## Files

- `minesweeper.py`: Contains the main logic and implementation of the Minesweeper game, including the AI solver.
- `runner.py`: Runs the Minesweeper game.
- `sprites/`: Folder containing the necessary images for the game.
- `fonts/`: Folder containing the necessary fonts for the game.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
4. Run `runner.py` using Python to start the game.

## AI Solver

The AI solver implemented in `minesweeper.py` uses simple logic and algorithms to make educated guesses and decisions while playing the game automatically.

## Dependencies

This project requires Python and Pygame to be installed on your system.
